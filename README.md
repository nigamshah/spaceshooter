============
Space shooter game for Arkadium
============

Here are some notes on the Spaceshooter game. It is kind of like a Galaga/Space Invaders type of game.

Controls

Left/Right Arrow - Move Player Horizontally
Left Ctl - Cannon (Quick repeating fire, low damage, unlimited ammo)
Left Alt - Missile (Slow fire, high damage, limited ammo)
Left Cmd - Freeze (Slow fire, zero damage/freezes target, limited ammo)

Enemies
There are 4 types of enemies, each with different abilities and scoring. They can use different types of weapons and some will launch themselves at the player.

Game Structure
The game is broken down into "Waves" which are group into Levels. There are currently 2 Levels with 3 Waves each. The Waves get progressively harder. If you make it past all the Waves, you win the game.

Lives
The player starts with 5 lives.

Game Win / Game Over - The game resets automatically.

I have included a compiled version for Mac OSX, as well as a web player version. They are in the "builds" directory.

To open the game in Unity, use the scene: "unity/Assets/Game/Scenes/Game.unity"

Let me know if you have any questions.
